# Mover

Included in the repository is a SQLite3 database.

The `MOVER_GOOGLE_API_KEY` needs to have access to 2 Google APIS:
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix?hl=en
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding?hl=en

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `MOVER_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_api_key> mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser and create some moving cost estimates.
